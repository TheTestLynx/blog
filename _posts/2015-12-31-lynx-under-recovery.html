<p>Hopefully you have noticed I have been away for a while now... that would mean you were following the posts and found them somehow interesting or helpful and I am grateful for that.</p>
<p>I have still many, many stories to tell and projects to explore with you...but sometimes a lynx gets too focused on hunting (projects at work, personal commitments, courses, last minute new year's resolutions...) When this happens, little time is left to tell stories to other lynx, but, at the same time, many other potential stories are being born.</p>
<p>So the goal of this post is just to let you know that the test lynx is still out there and soon to publish some more stories.</p>
<p>However, there would be a slight change on the way the stories are told... as you know, I always hint about my next story on the previous one. This has been proven to be not quite sustainable... So, I will eventually tell the hinted story, but, I might tell an unrelated story next with the goal of speeding up the posting and not to block potential 'out of the oven' stories.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, even though I have a great passion on automation and testing, I can only stretch so much... I am only a lynx being.</p>
<p>Now that we know each other for some time, you might be interested in knowing more about my own story...but, that is, definitely, well...a different story.</p>
