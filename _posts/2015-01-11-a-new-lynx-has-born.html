<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am a software engineer (in test). I have 5 years of working experience in the field, but I must say that I have been a tester since... well, always. In my opinion, this is something you are, not something you work on.</p>
<p>My goal for this blog is to share experiences, stories and learning. My dream is to be able to help anybody (interested), become a tester too. And if I can make it while writing interesting stories the better.</p>
<p>This blog is inspired in many others: some are from friends, but all of them are unknowingly mentors. Since I enjoy quite a lot the reading, I would like to share them with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>htps://codinggrace.com/</li>
<li>http://rhythmoftesting.blogspot.ie/</li>
<li>http://functionalkats.tumblr.com/</li>
<li>http://www.ministryoftesting.com/</li>
</ul>
<p>(I know I have forgotten some of them and I am sure I will find more on my learning path, so I will make sure I update this list.)</p>
<p>And that's all for my first post, short and concise, as tests should be. Maybe you were wondering about the lynx... you are showing tester's qualities if you were. However that's, well, another story...</p>

<p><em>Testing is like watching a movie after you read the book. (Noemi)</em></p>
