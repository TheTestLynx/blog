<p>As a developer, I often find myself stuck in a problem and I rarely get the freedom to switch my mind to a different task until I solved the first issue. But I need to be able to switch tasks, that's how my mind works.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that this is the trick to creativity: just do something else that is more automatic and then go back to the hard problem. While only developing, I find it hard to work on this 'all or nothing' way, it does not feel like I am creating, it feels like I'm forced into making the features.</p>
<p>Testing, for most companies I worked for, was at the exact same technical + programming level as the developer role. By this I mean: you needed to be a developer if you wanted to get the position and you get the same interviews.</p>
<p>At first, as tester, I felt unchallenged, as if I was just repeating tasks...and I do not mean manual testing, writing some tests automation could be repetitive as well. But that was until I learned that I could not only automate the tests, but also the processes. So I get more job done faster! I could do things in parallel, running tests that will show my results while writing code that will clear up my to do list... That's one of the reasons that I love it, besides the fact that you get to think out of the box and create new ways of solving and proving issues.</p>
<p>If you are curious about different roles across the two disciplines, here are the names of the roles I've done and what type of work they involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software developer: This is used as a generic term for someone that can write code (programs) and can also design technically the new features (sometimes with the help/agreement of other team members). There are many different types of developers and the number of positions are increasing and evolving with the years: front end, back end, full stack, devops, mobile, VR... And now you can find people really specialized in a particular language, so if you are starting on a position, make sure you like that language.</li>
<li>System verification tester: In my case, it was similar to software developer, only that instead of working with databases, back end, front end or applications, I was working on automation (and so with a bit of it all as well). You also need to be able to think out of the box and come up with tests that would help demonstrating quality. In this position, I, in particular, did not get to talk a lot with the developers of the system we were verifying, but it was common to check with the customers to make sure their quality criteria was met. There was also a degree of performance testing there. Basically, we were making sure the system was working across different platforms and specifications by writing code to check it.</li>
<li>SDET (software developer engineer in test). I really like this role, even thought it sounds as if I you are a 'provisional' developer, rather than a developer that works in the test side. I like that it has the word 'engineer' on it, which I deserve (I have two engineering degrees). In here, SDETs work in the same sort of things as the SDEs.  The only difference would be that while the SDEs work in making the code for the actual features, SDETs work in making the tests for those features and verifying they worked. Code reviews were done across disciplines making everybody familiar with all the code.</li>
<li>Software engineer: This is a recent enough title. If you see this, it means that in the company the developers also do the testing, usually switching between the two roles, or as part of BDD or TDD and with faster releases. I like this role as well, although quality tend to get lower priority in favour of faster releases and I particularly believe it is better to have someone in charge of quality so it does not get forgotten.</li>
<li>Software QA lead: 'Developer' and 'engineer' words are out of this name, but, I still got to do some degree of developing when I had this title. However, not as much as I wanted to get in this particular position, but I suppose that depends on your career goals and on the opportunities on the particular company to meet them. I did enjoy the leading part though, more below.</li>
<li>Software engineer lead: Same as number 4 but also leading. I am mentioning it because I had the wrong assumption, when I was a younger lynx, that the leaders did not get to do coding anymore. I am expected to do as much as the others, but I also have other leading tasks and have to keep an eye on the team. It is hard, but also quite rewarding because you get to help others and inspire them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to get the 'developer' label as little as the 'tester' one. I'm neither. I'm both.</p>
<p>Especially when you start labeling developers by their expertise. Could I be a front end developer? I could, but I'm not really. A back end? Even less... I'm sort of a 'all in one' and 'none of the above' at the same time.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that the developer types are becoming new positions, while some companies are moving away from the SDET title (which it's a developer type).</p>
<p>Dev and test positions keep evolving and changing across companies. How would testing be done in the future? That would be... well...a different story.</p>
