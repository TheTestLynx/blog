<p>If you are a regular reader of my blog, you are likely to expect a testing story. This is not exactly such, but have some patience, as I will link it with testing in upcoming posts.</p>
<p>Virtual reality is a field I was always curious about, from when I was a little lynx, before it was even possible to bring it to the users (as the devices were not quite portable back then).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I was looking to do a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree">nanodegree </a>course from Udacity to learn something new and keep myself updated. When you are working as a developer for a while (especially developers in test) you need to keep up to date. I once heard a feedback about a candidate that was interviewed by some friends, that he did not really have 10 years of experience, but he had a repeated 1 year of experience in a loop of 10, and this can easily happen to anybody. To avoid this, what I do and I recommend doing is: keep learning new stuff.</p>
<p>And so, I decided to course the VR nanodegree course in Udacity.</p>
<h3>Advises if you are considering VR nanodegree course:</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to know about virtual reality is that you will need a device for it, otherwise you won't be able to test anything you do.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to know about VR: if you want to work in multiple platforms, you also need multiple devices. This might seem obvious for you, but most of the current technologies (think about mobile, for example) have emulators to be able to deploy and test in different devices. However, for VR this is not there yet (as for the time I'm writing this article and my knowledge).</p>
<p>So, if you are planning in getting into the nanodegree course and into actual VR development, get ready to purchase an HTC vibe or an Oculus Rift, unless you are lucky enough to be able to borrow one or unless you prefer to take the speciality about cinematics and 360 recording. I ended up picking this speciality. Not that I did not want to spend the money on a VR cool device that would allow me to also play cool games, but I have recently moved countries (and continents, in fact) and I did not want to carry much stuff with me around.</p>
<p>One more thing to take into account: VR devices might come with minimum computer's specifications, so you might also need to update your computer in order for the device to work properly.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, in VR we can also develop for mobile, which only requires a cheap device in which to connect your phone (and you could even build <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2881175/emerging-technology/diy-build-your-own-google-cardboard-vr-viewer.html">your own one</a>). You can't do as many things as if you also have hands controllers and body movement detectors, but you can still do some cool things. For the nanodegree first modules, this is all you need and the course provides a cardboard to the students (which is great because it has a clicking option and some other devices don't have this one)</p>
<p>However, there is another thing that you could also get stuck with, although I think there are some workarounds but it would at least slow you down: you cannot directly develop for IOS phone from a windows device, you should do it from a MAC.</p>
<p>In terms of content, I would advise you to be interested in multimedia and gaming if you decide to go through the course.</p>
<h3>Feelings about the course itself</h3>
<p>I actually really enjoyed the course (except for the speciality that I was forced to course because of lack of devices). I think the content is quite good and the projects are challenging and open for creativity.</p>
<p>It's also great to network with other people with interest in VR.</p>
<p>In terms of testing on VR, there is currently not a module about this, but they do explain many things about performance, VR and what a good VR application should look like, so I believe this content is covered across the course.</p>
<h3>Where should I start if I want to learn more about VR?</h3>
<p>First of all, I think you can do this course for free if you don't mind not having the degree (you cannot access the evaluations). That could be a good starting point and you could always join for the assessments after, which might save you a bit of time and money.</p>
<p>However, I'd say that the best way to get started is to actually try a device and try some apps. In Android you can download the 'cardboard' app and expeditions. Also, you can look for VR apps or games in the phone store (whichever your phone's OS). Another way could be checking in steam (with a more expensive device), youtube or even in github to see someone's code. For example, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/NoemiElisa">mine</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you can also install unity as it has an emulator that might give you an idea on how the world would look like and try to start playing around. There is plenty of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com">documentation </a>about it. Another good tool to check out is <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/">unreal</a>, you don't need as much development skills with this one.</p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>So, you have checkout some VR apps and devices. You might even have created some small apps. The next step would be to be able to tell if your apps (or someone else's) are of good quality (this is a test focused blog, after all).  For this, we should have in mind some new considerations for every type of testing, but that's...well...another story.</p>
