<p>One of the most common question I get when people reach out to me about virtual reality (VR) is: how could I get started? Even thought I already have written an <a href="https://thetestlynx.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/virtual-reality-start-pack-and-vr-udacity-nanodegree-experience/">article</a> about this, but maybe I should talk about my own experience instead so you can get more specific examples about it. If you are not into VR, please bear with me, as what I'm about to tell you can help you getting into any topics you wish to get into.<!--StartFragment--></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My first experience with a VR device was during a <strong>hackathon </strong>in Microsoft, when one of the interns brought his Oculus Rift. Back then it was a very expensive device, so it was very interesting to be able to play around with one. But I found that it would still have some issues to solve, starting for adding hands gestures.  </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As life goes, sometimes you get stuck in what you are doing at work and don't get the time to investigate interesting new things. In my case, I bought a house and there was a lot of stress related to this. It was not until years later that I actually got the chance to try again another device, this time it was over mobile on a <strong>meetup </strong>called "tech for good" in Dublin.  In this meetup, they were using VR mobile devices to provide social impact. It was my first experience with phone VR and I thought: Ok, now this is something that anybody can use and get, therefore it is something that is going to need testing.   </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After that, another hackathon (this time an open <a href="https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/">Nasa hackathon</a>) got my interest in VR and AR back. I highly recommend this hackathon as I made really good friends there and we had so much fun building a AR/VR experience to navigate a satellite. My team (who won the local People's choice award in Dublin) created an application  that simulate a satellite around the orbit (on AR) and translate to see  the view from that satellite (VR).  If you are interested, <a href="https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/ideate-and-create/space-jockey/teams/malax">here</a> is our project  </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> When I found myself having more time, I started looking for information about VR. I found a <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/vr-foundations-nanodegree--nd105">Udacity course</a> on VR and decided to take it on.  Back when I started it, the <strong>course </strong>covered many topics, although they made the decision of separating the courses in different specialties, which makes much more sense. If you are interested in seeing some of the projects I made during this course, check my <a href="https://github.com/TheTestLynx">Github account</a>.  </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
After that, I got interested in <strong>open source projects</strong> on<br />
 AR and wanted to  start doing testing there... However, life got in the<br />
 way again when I  moved to China. It's still on my to-do list. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> I was lucky enough to start <strong>working </strong>for Netease Games in China right after, so I had then enough flexibility and hardware access to do some more research in VR including some automated testing with Google Cardboard, which it should be now integrated in <a href="http://airtest.netease.com/">Airtest project</a> (I know, not many people are using Google Cardboard anymore but, hey, you need to start somewhere.. the other research is still ongoing)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> I also was lucky to have the opportunity to attend to the second <a href="https://sonarhongkong.com/">Sonar</a> in Hong Kong, which is a music and technology <strong>festival</strong>, and it showcased some cool new technologies and devices in VR (including aroma experiences and snow-surfing) </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> Besides that, I started to think of plans and ways of testing VR applications too (as Netease was working in some projects like <a href="http://nostos.163.com/">nostos</a>, which I had the opportunity to try myself and really enjoyed it).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Around that time, I gave a <strong>talk </strong>in Selenium conference in India gathering all this gained knowledge (which I talked about on <a href="https://thetestlynx.wordpress.com/2018/08/18/talking-in-selenium-conference/">this post</a>).  In order to prepare for this talk I <strong>played around </strong>and created my own 'conference simulator' just to get prepared for it.  </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another thing I do frequently to gain knowledge in VR is to <strong>watch </strong>playthroughs and <strong>online reviews</strong>, as you can learn a lot from watching others play and it could be very good to understand your potential users if you are working on a game. I also have read some <strong>books </strong>on the matter (shout out to <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">packtpub </a>which gives away free IT books everyday!)</p>

<h3>Have you found a pattern? </h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I know you have, if you are a reader of this blog you surely are a clever Lynx by now, but just in case, I have highlighted it in bold letters: Attending to (and after a while starting) hackathons, meetups, talks and festivals, watching or reading online related content and books, and playing around in courses, open source projects, at work and on your own projects will get you into anything you are interested to get into.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It sure sounds like a lot of things to do, but the tools are already around you, and I'm talking about years worth of experience here. Just take one thing at a time and you will too become an expert of that thing you are into. The biggest difficulty is to pick which one to take at any given time and to be honest about yourself and how much time you can spend on that. (I regret a ton not having put more efforts on the AR open source project when I had the chance)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, if you are not really into it, then it would sound like a lot of work, in which case it's probably better to save yourself time and pick something else. I like to think of it as a test of passion, or on the words of 'Randy Pausch' from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">talk </a>'Achieving Your Childhood Dreams': "brick walls".  (By the way, this is one of the best motivational talks I've ever watch, and I actually re-watch it at least once a year to keep me motivated. Also, it mentions VR too :) ) </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As you would imagine, this is not the only subject I spent time with or I gave my attention to, another big one for me is artificial intelligence, but that's...well...another story.</p>
