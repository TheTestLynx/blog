<p>I am a computer scientist with more than 10 years of working experience in development and testing positions, but I must say that I have been a tester sinceâ€¦ well, always.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My&nbsp;goal is to share experiences, stories, learning and research on new technologies in testing. My dream is to be able to help&nbsp;anybody (interested), become a developer and a tester too. And if I can make it while writing interesting stories the better. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I self-taught myself developing and testing when I was 8 years old, with the BASIC programming language, when I was getting "Syntax error" loading games and I decided to learn how to fix and make them. This early passion drove me to get a hardware engineering, software engineering and master degrees in Computer Science.</p>
